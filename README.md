# Rancid Tomatillos

##[View The Deployed Site Here](https://lit-falls-58194.herokuapp.com/)

##Overview

Rancid Tomatillos is a Mod 3 Front-End Turing project, with the goal of creating a movie database in React. The site displays a series of cards, each corresponding to a movie in our database, and allows the user to click on a card to view a more specific detail page with data such as its title, rating, description, release date, and trailer. React's conditional component rendering, as well as Router, allow us to specify a URL path for each movie, making navigation of the site much smoother and easier.

The project consisted of several iterations, with each one both expanding on and refactoring the last, and gaining complexity; for instance, the first iteration was just to display all of the movies as cards on the page, drawing from a hardcoded data file, while the third was to get the movie data from an API call rather than a hardcoded local file. The overall goals were to:

1. Gain fundamental knowledge of React and components
2. Learn how to test React and asynchronous JS
3. Practice refactoring
4. Create a multi-page app using Router
5. Practice collaborating with others and maintaining a good workflow

## Learning Goals and Objectives

*Claire:* My goal for this project was to get comfortable using React, React-Router and Cypress to make and test a multi-page application. In addition, I'm happy we were able to use a couple hooks throughout the app, for the hover states on the main page, and for the scrolling. Deploying to Heroku was simple, but it's very exciting to have an application that my friends, family, and future employers can easily view.

*Dean:* I also wanted to prioritize getting comfortable using React, as it was a new technology for both of us, to gain a better understanding of Router to be able to build more easily-navigated and modern apps, and really solidify my grasp on API calls. Throughout working on this app, my priority shifted a little bit to get some time building Cypress tests, as that was a bit of a weak point of understanding for me, and I was able to feel more confident after some time reading documentation and writing out various user flows. I'm also really glad we were able to get the site deployed to Heroku for our 'Choose Your Own' final iteration, as that's a valuable skill I'm sure we'll use more as we continue building more complex apps with larger back-end structures.

## Future Extensions

 - [X] Deploy the site to Heroku for a live, viewable app
 - [ ] Build out live search bar to allow users to search for a movie, and filter movies shown as they type
 - [ ] Create our own Express server to store our own movie data
